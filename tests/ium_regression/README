1. Usage
-----------------------------------------------------
cd bigtest/tests/ium_regression
./run_all.sh  [-m <SINGLE|MULTI>] [-r]
E.g.
"./run_all.sh -r" for first time run
"./run_all.sh -m SINGLE" same as "./run_all.sh"
"./run_all.sh -m MULTI"


Command-line options
    -h : show usage
    -m : run in SINGLE or MULTI mode, SINGLE mode means run locally, MULTI means run in cluster, default=SINGLE
    -r : refresh the tigergraph.bin and pkg.tar.gz, first time run must with this option

2. Config
-----------------------------------------------------
In MultiNode mode, you should change the file /config_sample/MultiNode.cfg, mainly about your cluster information.
E.g.
Change "cluster.nodes: m1:192.168.33.81,m2:192.168.33.82" to "cluster.nodes: m1:test_machine_ip1,m2:test_machine_ip2,..."
Also you may should change "**.servers" related config.

3. redis-server
-----------------------------------------------------
Please make sure redis-server is on, or the gadmin check command may fail.

4. ssh
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Please make sure you have are ssh free to each other(include itself) in the cluster.nodes(mean the test machines).
2. Please make sure you have ssh to the IP in "cluster.nodes", or the interact information may block you.
E.g.
The authenticity of host '192.168.136.161 (192.168.136.161)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 3d:9d:79:7b:20:88:fb:4a:9e:0d:96:9a:83:d0:83:e1.
