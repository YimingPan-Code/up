/* Rochaâ€“Thatte cycle detection algorithm
This is a distributed algorithm for detecting all the cycles on large-scale directed graphs.In every iteration, the vertices send its sequences to its out-neighbors, and receive the sequences from the in-neighbors.
Stop passing the sequence (v1,v2,v3, ...) when:
1. v = v1. If v has the minimum label in the sequence, report the cycle
2. v = vi (i!=1). Do not report since this cycle is already reported in an earlier iteration
